The path is **patient-centric** and flows like this:

```
Person → Visit_occurrence → Procedure_occurrence → Image_occurrence → Image_feature
```

Each step uses **primary keys (PK)** and **foreign keys (FK)** to maintain referential integrity.

---

### **Person Table**

* **Purpose:** Identifies the patient.
* **Key fields:**

  * `person_id` (PK) = unique identifier for each patient.

**Example row:**

| P001       | Male   | 1965-03-12  |

---

### **Visit\_occurrence Table**

* **Purpose:** Represents a healthcare encounter (e.g., outpatient visit, ER admission).
* **Keys:**

---

### **Procedure\_occurrence Table**

* **Purpose:** Records that a procedure was performed (e.g., CT Chest).
* **Keys:**

  * `procedure_occurrence_id` (PK)
  * `person_id` (FK → Person)
  * `visit_occurrence_id` (FK → Visit\_occurrence)

**Example row:**

---

### **Image\_occurrence Table** (MI-CDM extension)

* **Purpose:** Links procedure to the actual DICOM study/series.
* **Keys:**

  * `image_occurrence_id` (PK)
  * `person_id` (FK → Person)
  * `procedure_occurrence_id` (FK → Procedure\_occurrence)
  * `visit_occurrence_id` (FK → Visit\_occurrence)

**Example row:**

| image\_occurrence\_id | person\_id | procedure\_occurrence\_id | visit\_occurrence\_id | study\_UID | series\_UID | modality\_concept\_id | anatomic\_site\_concept\_id |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------- | ----------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| IMG101                | P001       | PR5001                    | V1001                 | 1.2.840…   | 1.3.6.1.4…  | CT                    | Chest                       |

---

### **Image\_feature Table** (MI-CDM extension)

* **Purpose:** Captures features/findings derived from the images.
* **Keys:**

  * `image_feature_id` (PK)
  * `person_id` (FK → Person)
  * `image_occurrence_id` (FK → Image\_occurrence)
  * `image_feature_event_id` (FK → Measurement/Observation table)

---

### Putting It All Together

* **Person**: P001 is the patient.
* **Visit\_occurrence**: P001 visits outpatient clinic on Jan 10, 2024.
* **Procedure\_occurrence**: During visit, a CT Chest (SNOMED: 36715236) is ordered and performed.
* **Image\_occurrence**: That procedure links to the actual DICOM study (UIDs, modality=CT, site=Chest).
* **Image\_feature**: From that study, an AI algorithm extracts a pulmonary nodule feature (8 mm, solid).

---

👉 This chain ensures full **traceability**:
We can follow the patient from **clinical encounter → imaging procedure → DICOM study → extracted features**.

## Image feature to Clinical Table

::: {.callout-note appearance="default" collapse="false"}
**Q:** Show me how the Image_feature can be linked to the Condition_occurence, Measurement, and Observation table with example. Again, show PK/FK.
:::


In the **Image\_feature table**, two special fields are used for linkage:

* `image_feature_event_field_concept_id` → tells **which clinical table** the feature lives in
  (e.g., Measurement, Observation, Condition\_occurrence).
* `image_feature_event_id` → points to the **primary key (PK)** in that clinical table.

So, `Image_feature` acts like a *bridge table* that connects features to existing OMOP entities.

---

### Link to **Measurement Table**

* **Use case:** Quantitative measurements from images (e.g., nodule diameter, CT attenuation).

**Tables:**

* `Measurement`

  * PK = `measurement_id`
* `Image_feature`

  * FK = `image_feature_event_id` (points to `measurement_id`)
  * FK = `image_feature_event_field_concept_id` (tells us this ID belongs to Measurement table).

**Example:**

* Measurement row:

  | measurement\_id | person\_id | measurement\_concept\_id                      | value\_as\_number | unit | date       |
  | --------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---- | ---------- |
  | M7001           | P001       | LOINC: “Longest diameter of pulmonary nodule” | 8                 | mm   | 2024-01-10 |

* Image\_feature row:

  | image\_feature\_id | image\_occurrence\_id | image\_feature\_concept\_id                   | image\_feature\_event\_id | image\_feature\_event\_field\_concept\_id |
  | ------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
  | F301               | IMG101                | LOINC: “Longest diameter of pulmonary nodule” | **M7001**                 | Concept: Measurement                      |

---

### Link to **Observation Table**

* **Use case:** Qualitative or categorical descriptors (e.g., “solid vs ground-glass,” “spiculated margin”).

**Tables:**

* `Observation`

  * PK = `observation_id`
* `Image_feature`

  * FK = `image_feature_event_id` (points to `observation_id`)

**Example:**

* Observation row:

  | observation\_id | person\_id | observation\_concept\_id          | value\_as\_concept\_id | date       |
  | --------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------- |
  | O8001           | P001       | RadLex: “Pulmonary nodule margin” | RadLex: “Spiculated”   | 2024-01-10 |

* Image\_feature row:

  | image\_feature\_id | image\_occurrence\_id | image\_feature\_concept\_id | image\_feature\_event\_id | image\_feature\_event\_field\_concept\_id |
  | ------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
  | F302               | IMG101                | RadLex: “Spiculated”        | **O8001**                 | Concept: Observation                      |

---

### Link to **Condition\_occurrence Table**

* **Use case:** Diagnoses inferred from imaging (e.g., “Lung cancer,” “Lung-RADS 4B”).

**Tables:**

* `Condition_occurrence`

  * PK = `condition_occurrence_id`
* `Image_feature`

  * FK = `image_feature_event_id` (points to `condition_occurrence_id`)

**Example:**

* Condition\_occurrence row:

  | condition\_occurrence\_id | person\_id | condition\_concept\_id                             | condition\_start\_date |
  | ------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
  | C6001                     | P001       | SNOMED: “Malignant neoplasm of upper lobe of lung” | 2024-01-20             |

* Image\_feature row:

  | image\_feature\_id | image\_occurrence\_id | image\_feature\_concept\_id           | image\_feature\_event\_id | image\_feature\_event\_field\_concept\_id |
  | ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
  | F303               | IMG101                | RadLex: “Lung-RADS 4B classification” | **C6001**                 | Concept: Condition\_occurrence            |

---

### Big Picture

* **Measurements**: numeric imaging biomarkers (diameter, density, attenuation).
* **Observations**: categorical imaging descriptors (solid, spiculated, lobulated).
* **Condition\_occurrences**: imaging-based diagnoses or classifications (lung cancer, Lung-RADS).

The **Image\_feature table** ties them all together by recording **which DICOM study/series they came from, what algorithm or report created them, and where in the OMOP model the actual values live.**


## Concept ID

::: {.callout-note appearance="default" collapse="false"}
**Q:** Explain what the concept ID (*_concept_id) is
:::

Great question --- **concept IDs** are central to how the OMOP CDM (and now the MI-CDM extension) work.

---

###  What is a `*_concept_id`?

* In OMOP CDM, **every clinical concept** (diagnosis, procedure, measurement, drug, imaging modality, anatomical site, etc.) is mapped to a **unique integer identifier** called a **concept\_id**.
* These IDs live in the **Concept table** of OMOP.
* Instead of storing free-text or raw codes (like ICD-10, LOINC, SNOMED, DICOM tags, RadLex terms), OMOP standardizes them into a **common vocabulary system**.

---

###  Why use `concept_id`?

1. **Standardization**

   * Different hospitals may record the same concept differently (ICD-10 vs SNOMED vs RadLex).
   * OMOP maps them all to the same `concept_id` -> ensuring interoperability.

2. **Computable queries**

   * You can query across institutions without worrying about local coding differences.
   * Example: "CT Chest" might be CPT **71250** in the US, but in Korea another code. Both map to the same OMOP `concept_id`.

3. **Relationships & Hierarchies**

   * `concept_id` connects to `concept_relationship` and `concept_ancestor` tables -> allowing you to query hierarchies (e.g., "find all imaging procedures that are CT scans of the chest").

---

###  Where do you see `*_concept_id`?

In the MI-CDM tables:

#### **Image\_occurrence**

* `modality_concept_id` -> DICOM modality (e.g., CT, MR, US).
* `anatomic_site_concept_id` -> body part imaged (e.g., Chest, Liver).

#### **Image\_feature**

* `image_feature_concept_id` -> the specific feature (e.g., "Longest diameter of pulmonary nodule," "Ground glass opacity").
* `image_feature_type_concept_id` -> provenance (e.g., DICOM SR, AI algorithm, NLP extraction).
* `image_finding_concept_id` -> grouping (e.g., "Pulmonary nodule").
* `anatomic_site_concept_id` -> location of the feature (e.g., "Left lower lobe").

---

###  Example with Real IDs (simplified)

Suppose patient **P001** has a CT chest with a lung nodule:

* **Procedure\_occurrence**

  * `procedure_concept_id = 36715236` -> *"CT of chest"*

* **Image\_occurrence**

  * `modality_concept_id = 44814653` -> *"CT"*
  * `anatomic_site_concept_id = 4144262` -> *"Chest"*

* **Image\_feature**

  * `image_feature_concept_id = 3026910` -> *"Longest diameter of pulmonary nodule (LOINC)"*
  * `image_feature_type_concept_id = 45884084` -> *"Extracted by algorithm"*
  * `image_finding_concept_id = 45756815` -> *"Pulmonary nodule (RadLex)"*
  * Value = 8 mm

---

 **Key point:**
The `concept_id` makes sure that no matter the coding system (LOINC, SNOMED, RadLex, DICOM), the feature or event is **normalized into a unified vocabulary** for analytics.
