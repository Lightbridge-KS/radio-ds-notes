# FHIR - Foundation

## FHIR JSON Overview

FHIR JSON representation is based on the JSON format described in STD 90 (RFC 8259) and follows a structured approach for representing healthcare data. In radiology data science, this standardization is crucial for interoperability between imaging systems, PACS, and analytics platforms.

## Basic JSON Structure

Every FHIR resource is a JSON object with a property `resourceType` which informs the parser which resource type this is:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Patient",
  "id": "patient-123",
  "name": [{
    "use": "official",
    "family": "Smith",
    "given": ["John"]
  }]
}
```

## Key JSON Representation Rules

### 1. Primitive Data Types
FHIR elements with primitive datatypes are represented in two parts: a JSON property that contains the value, and optionally, an additional JSON property with _ prepended to the name of the element, which, if present, contains the value's id and/or extensions.

Example with a date:
```json
{
  "birthDate": "1972-11-30",
  "_birthDate": {
    "extension": [{
      "url": "http://example.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/precision",
      "valueString": "estimated"
    }]
  }
}
```

### 2. Arrays for Repeating Elements
An element that has a maximum cardinality of >1 may occur more than once in the instance. In JSON, this is done by using an array type.

## Radiology-Specific Examples

### Example 1: ImagingStudy Resource (Minimal)
```json
{
  "resourceType": "ImagingStudy",
  "id": "study-001",
  "status": "available",
  "subject": {
    "reference": "Patient/patient-123"
  },
  "started": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "numberOfSeries": 3,
  "numberOfInstances": 45,
  "modality": [{
    "system": "http://dicom.nema.org/resources/ontology/DCM",
    "code": "CT",
    "display": "Computed Tomography"
  }]
}
```

### Example 2: DiagnosticReport Resource (Radiology Report)
```json
{
  "resourceType": "DiagnosticReport",
  "id": "radiology-report-001",
  "status": "final",
  "category": [{
    "coding": [{
      "system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0074",
      "code": "RAD",
      "display": "Radiology"
    }]
  }],
  "code": {
    "coding": [{
      "system": "http://loinc.org",
      "code": "36643-5",
      "display": "CT chest"
    }]
  },
  "subject": {
    "reference": "Patient/patient-123"
  },
  "effectiveDateTime": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "conclusion": "No acute findings"
}
```

### Example 3: Observation Resource (Imaging Measurements)
```json
{
  "resourceType": "Observation",
  "id": "lesion-measurement-001",
  "status": "final",
  "category": [{
    "coding": [{
      "system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/observation-category",
      "code": "imaging",
      "display": "Imaging"
    }]
  }],
  "code": {
    "coding": [{
      "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
      "code": "410668003",
      "display": "Length"
    }]
  },
  "subject": {
    "reference": "Patient/patient-123"
  },
  "valueQuantity": {
    "value": 12.5,
    "unit": "mm",
    "system": "http://unitsofmeasure.org",
    "code": "mm"
  }
}
```

## Important Considerations for Radiology Data Science

1. **CodeableConcept Structure**: A CodeableConcept is represented in JSON with a "coding" array containing system-code pairs, which is essential for standardized radiology terminology (SNOMED CT, RadLex, LOINC).

2. **Extensions**: Critical for radiology-specific data that may not be covered by base FHIR resources, such as imaging protocol parameters or AI model predictions.

3. **References**: Used to link related resources (Patient → ImagingStudy → DiagnosticReport → Observations), maintaining data relationships crucial for comprehensive radiology workflows.

4. **Precision Handling**: JavaScript natively supports only one numeric datatype, which can cause loss of precision for FHIR numbers, including trailing zeros after decimal points - important for accurate measurement data in radiology.

This JSON structure enables efficient data exchange between radiology systems, supports machine learning pipelines with standardized data formats, and facilitates integration with clinical decision support systems in radiology workflows.
