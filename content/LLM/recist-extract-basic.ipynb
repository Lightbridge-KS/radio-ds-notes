    "\n",
    "**HISTORY:** A 79-year-old woman, known history of NSCLC S/P right upper lobectomy with lung metastasis, was sent for evaluation.\n",
    "**Technique:** Axial scans of the brain, chest, and whole abdomen were performed with IV contrast material according to the standard divisional protocol.  \n",
    "**COMPARISON:** Prior baseline CT chest and whole abdomen obtained on 12/11/2023\n",
    "\n",
    "**FINDINGS:**  \n",
    "**Tube and line:** None.  \n",
    "**Lungs and airways:** Evidence of post right upper lobectomy with no significant change of the heterogeneous enhancing soft tissue at the RML, adjacent to the bronchial stump, now measuring about 1.7x2.5 cm in transaxial dimension. The soft tissue mass involves the RML bronchus, causing complete atelectasis of the RML.  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are slightly decreased in size of several peribronchial part-solid nodules and masses with spiculate borders at the RLL. The target lesion#1 decreases size from 2.84 cm to 2.62 cm in greatest transaxial diameter (target#1; Im 67 Se 210). There is also decreased size of the largest nodule with pleural tagging and peripheral subsegmental atelectasis/fibrosis in the superior segment of the RLL from 3.8x4.6 cm to 3.5x4.0 cm (Im 58 Se 210).  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a slight increase in size of the part-solid pulmonary nodule in the superior segment of the RLL (Im 59 Se 210) from 0.68 cm to 1.19 cm. No change of a tiny ground-glass nodule at the apicoposterior segment of the LUL. Also, no change of fibrosis at bilateral basal lungs and the inferior lingular segment of the LUL.  \n",
    "**Pleura:** No significant change of nodular pleural thickening along the right 5th-6th posterolateral costal pleura, now measuring up to 1.5x3.1 cm (Im 54, Se 601). Minimal loculated right pleural effusion is seen. No pneumothorax is observed.  \n",
    "**Mediastinum:** No significant mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy is seen. Normal heart size without pericardial effusion. Unremarkable visualization of the thoracic aorta and esophagus.  \n",
    "**Thyroid gland:** No change of several small hypodense nodules in both thyroid glands.  \n",
    "**Liver and biliary:** Normal attenuation, size, and contour. No intrahepatic duct dilatation. Portal and hepatic veins and IVC are patent. Stable 0.8-cm hypodense lesion at segment V, likely a small cyst. No calcified gallstones, gallbladder wall thickening, or mass. No biliary ductal dilatation.  \n",
    "**Spleen:** No splenomegaly.  \n",
    "**Pancreas:** No focal mass or ductal dilatation.  \n",

No change of fat-containing nodules at the upper poles of both kidneys (RK = 1.0 cm, LK = 0.7 cm), likely angiomyolipomas (AMLs). A few tiny left renal cysts are observed. No focal mass, stone, or hydronephrosis.  \n",

    "**Abdominal vessels:** Mild aortic atherosclerosis.  \n",
    "**Chest wall and bony structures:** No change of a small sclerotic lesion at the left posteriolateral 4th rib. Dense sclerotic lesions at the bilateral pelvic bones are likely bone islands.\n",
