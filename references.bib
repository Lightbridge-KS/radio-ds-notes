  abstract     = {Radiomics refers to the extraction of mineable data from medical imaging and has been applied within oncology to improve diagnosis, prognostication, and clinical decision support, with the goal of delivering precision medicine. The authors provide a practical approach for successfully implementing a radiomic workflow from planning and conceptualization through manuscript writing. Applications in oncology typically are either classification tasks that involve computing the probability of a sample belonging to a category, such as benign versus malignant, or prediction of clinical events with a time-to-event analysis, such as overall survival. The radiomic workflow is multidisciplinary, involving radiologists and data and imaging scientists, and follows a stepwise process involving tumor segmentation, image preprocessing, feature extraction, model development, and validation. Images are curated and processed before segmentation, which can be performed on tumors, tumor subregions, or peritumoral zones. Extracted features typically describe the distribution of signal intensities and spatial relationship of pixels within a region of interest. To improve model performance and reduce overfitting, redundant and nonreproducible features are removed. Validation is essential to estimate model performance in new data and can be performed iteratively on samples of the dataset (cross-validation) or on a separate hold-out dataset by using internal or external data. A variety of noncommercial and commercial radiomic software applications can be used. Guidelines and artificial intelligence checklists are useful when planning and writing up radiomic studies. Although interest in the field continues to grow, radiologists should be familiar with potential pitfalls to ensure that meaningful conclusions can be drawn.

However, there are a number of settings when undertaking a pilot trial when there is no prior information to base a sample size on.

  abstract     = {PURPOSE: Many radiomics features were originally developed for non-medical imaging applications and therefore original assumptions may need to be reexamined. In this study, we investigated the impact of slice thickness and pixel spacing (or pixel size) on radiomics features extracted from Computed Tomography (CT) phantom images acquired with different scanners as well as different acquisition and reconstruction parameters. The dependence of CT texture features on gray-level discretization was also evaluated.
  
  METHODS AND MATERIALS: A texture phantom composed of 10 different cartridges of different materials was scanned on eight different CT scanners from three different manufacturers. The images were reconstructed for various slice thicknesses. For each slice thickness, the reconstruction Field Of View (FOV) was varied to render pixel sizes ranging from 0.39 to 0.98 mm. A fixed spherical region of interest (ROI) was contoured on the images of the shredded rubber cartridge and the 3D printed, 20\% fill, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic cartridge (ABS20) for all phantom imaging sets. Radiomic features were extracted from the ROIs using an in-house program. Features categories were: shape (10), intensity (16), GLCM (24), GLZSM (11), GLRLM (11), and NGTDM (5), fractal dimensions (8) and first-order wavelets (128), for a total of 213 features. Voxel-size resampling was performed to investigate the usefulness of extracting features using a suitably chosen voxel size. Acquired phantom image sets were resampled to a voxel size of 1 × 1 × 2 mm3 using linear interpolation. Image features were therefore extracted from resampled and original datasets and the absolute value of the percent coefficient of variation (\%COV) for each feature was calculated. Based on the \%COV values, features were classified in 3 groups: (1) features with large variations before and after resampling (\%COV >50); (2) features with diminished variation (\%COV <30) after resampling; and (3) features that had originally moderate variation (\%COV <50\%) and were negligibly affected by resampling. Group 2 features were further studied by modifying feature definitions to include voxel size. Original and voxel-size normalized features were used for interscanner comparisons. A subsequent analysis investigated feature dependency on gray-level discretization by extracting 51 texture features from ROIs from each of the 10 different phantom cartridges using 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256 gray levels.
  
  RESULTS: Out of the 213 features extracted, 150 were reproducible across voxel sizes, 42 improved significantly (\%COV <30, Group 2) after resampling, and 21 had large variations before and after resampling (Group 1). Ten features improved significantly after definition modification effectively removed their voxel-size dependency. Interscanner comparison indicated that feature variability among scanners nearly vanished for 8 of these 10 features. Furthermore, 17 out of 51 texture features were found to be dependent on the number of gray levels. These features were redefined to include the number of gray levels which greatly reduced this dependency.
  
  CONCLUSION: Voxel-size resampling is an appropriate pre-processing step for image datasets acquired with variable voxel sizes to obtain more reproducible CT features. We found that some of the radiomics features were voxel size and gray-level discretization-dependent. The introduction of normalizing factors in their definitions greatly reduced or removed these dependencies.},

  abstract     = {OBJECTIVE: Before implementing radiomics in routine clinical practice, comprehensive knowledge about the repeatability and reproducibility of radiomic features is required. The aim of this study was to systematically investigate the influence of image processing parameters on radiomic features from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in terms of feature values as well as test-retest repeatability.
  
  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Utilizing a phantom consisting of 4 onions, 4 limes, 4 kiwifruits, and 4 apples, we acquired a test-retest dataset featuring 3 of the most commonly used MRI sequences on a 3 T scanner, namely, a T1-weighted, a T2-weighted, and a fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence, each at high and low resolution. After semiautomatic image segmentation, image processing with systematic variation of image processing parameters was performed, including spatial resampling, intensity discretization, and intensity rescaling. For each respective image processing setting, a total of 45 radiomic features were extracted, corresponding to the following 7 matrices/feature classes: conventional indices, histogram matrix, shape matrix, gray-level zone length matrix, gray-level run length matrix, neighboring gray-level dependence matrix, and gray-level cooccurrence matrix. Systematic differences of individual features between different resampling steps were assessed using 1-way analysis of variance with Tukey-type post hoc comparisons to adjust for multiple testing. Test-retest repeatability of radiomic features was measured using the concordance correlation coefficient, dynamic range, and intraclass correlation coefficient.
  
  RESULTS: Image processing influenced radiological feature values. Regardless of the acquired sequence and feature class, significant differences ( P < 0.05) in feature values were found when the size of the resampled voxels was too large, that is, bigger than 3 mm. Almost all higher-order features depended strongly on intensity discretization. The effects of intensity rescaling were negligible except for some features derived from T1-weighted sequences. For all sequences, the percentage of repeatable features (concordance correlation coefficient and dynamic range ≥ 0.9) varied considerably depending on the image processing settings. The optimal image processing setting to achieve the highest percentage of stable features varied per sequence. Irrespective of image processing, the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence in high-resolution overall yielded the highest number of stable features in comparison with the other sequences (89\% vs 64\%-78\% for the respective optimal image processing settings). Across all sequences, the most repeatable features were generally obtained for a spatial resampling close to the originally acquired voxel size and an intensity discretization to at least 32 bins.
  
  CONCLUSION: Variation of image processing parameters has a significant impact on the values of radiomic features as well as their repeatability. Furthermore, the optimal image processing parameters differ for each MRI sequence. Therefore, it is recommended that these processing parameters be determined in corresponding test-retest scans before clinical application. Extensive repeatability, reproducibility, and validation studies as well as standardization are required before quantitative image analysis and radiomics can be reliably translated into routine clinical care.},
